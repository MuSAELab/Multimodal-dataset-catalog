[**TORGO**](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~complingweb/data/TORGO/torgo.html): in-lab voice recordings from individuals with dysarthria. It also provides the text groudtruth and articulatory traces.

[**Nemours**](): (link to be updated) ~800 sentence utterances collected in-lab from individuals with different degrees of dysarthria. Labels are intelligibility.
